# Positive-cone non-Archimedean multiplier theorem

This file proves the positive-cone version of the non-Archimedean multiplier
estimate.  The key additional structure compared to the non-positive version is
that the source representation `R` uses canonical Souza atoms (i.e. is a
`SouzaPositiveRepresentation`), and the multipliers satisfy a
`SouzaPositivePointwiseSelfsTailBound` that controls products with those
canonical atoms. The output representation inherits the positivity structure.

## Bridging positive tail bounds to real tail bounds

When `R` is a `SouzaPositiveRepresentation`, each active level-cell atom is the
canonical Souza s-atom.  The `SouzaPositivePointwiseSelfsTailBound` hypothesis
controls products with canonical β-atoms (obtained from the canonical s-atom via
`exists_beta_souzaAtom_of_s_souzaAtom`).  The next private lemma extracts a real
`SouzaPointwiseSelfsTailBound` from a positive one when the bound is finite.

This derivation uses `souzaBesovNorm_le_souzaPositiveNorm`: the standard Besov
norm is at most the positive gauge, so a finite positive gauge gives a finite real
bound.

A finite positive pointwise-selfs tail bound implies a real pointwise-selfs
tail bound with value `C.toReal`.

The proof proceeds cell by cell: `SouzaPositivePointwiseSelfsTailBound` provides
a positive Besov representative with `souzaPositiveNorm ≤ C`; the inequality
`souzaBesovNorm_le_souzaPositiveNorm` then yields `Norm_Costpq ≤ C.toReal`.
Note that this only covers the canonical atom at each cell, not all atoms.  The
full `SouzaPointwiseSelfsTailBound` (which quantifies over all atoms) cannot be
derived from the positive bound alone.  The proof of the main theorem works
around this restriction by using the fact that `R` only contains canonical atoms.

## Main theorem: positive-cone non-Archimedean estimate
-/

/--
Positive-cone non-Archimedean estimate for finite multiplier sums.

This is the positive analogue of `souzaNonArchimedeanPropertyLambdaFinite`, with
the two consequences of Remark `posrem` separated according to their true
strengths.  We only assume that the source representation `R` is **canonical**
(`SouzaCanonicalRepresentation`: all atoms are canonical Souza atoms), with
**arbitrary** complex coefficients, and that each multiplier `g i` is a
`SouzaPositiveFunction`.  Under the per-cell overlap bound `N` we obtain a single
output representation `S` of `(∑ᵢ gᵢ)·f` such that:

* `pqCost S ≤ Cgen · N · pqCost R` (the cost bound);
* **[ii]** every active cell of `S` is contained in the support of some `g i`
  (this needs only canonical atoms on `R`, **not** sign conditions on `c_Q`);
* **[i]** *if* `R` is in addition fully positive (`SouzaPositiveRepresentation`,
  i.e. canonical atoms **and** nonnegative real coefficients) then so is `S`.

The separation is essential: the output atom `d_P` is a normalised signed
combination `m_P⁻¹ ∑ c_Q s_{P,Q} b_{P,Q}`, so its canonicity (hence positivity of
`S`) requires `c_Q ≥ 0`; the support statement does not.  This mirrors the
transmutation `Claim B` (support) versus `Claim B_sharp` (positivity).

The intended proof is independent of the non-positive core: it builds positive
local transmutation data (`RepresentationWsubGandALS_pos`) from the positive
multipliers and canonical source atoms, and reads off cost / support / positivity
from `Transmutation_of_Atoms_Claim_A` / `_Claim_B` / `_Claim_B_sharp`.
